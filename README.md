Free Orphan Education Program
Orphan and vulnerable children who have either lost one or both parents live in extreme poverty with their guardians with little access to basic needs. Brave Hearts’ educational project covers children’s school fees, tutorial lessons, after school meals, school uniforms and materials. Children receive after school meals and tutorial lessons at our drop in center with a library and other services. SACH helps these children build a bright future through quality <a href="http://sachpak.org/education/">education</a> and holistic care.
